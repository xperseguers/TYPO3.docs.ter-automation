    Fix bug in ./T3PythonDocBuilder to avoid crash when the OpenOffice
    manual doesn't contain a single image.

    GIF files are now converted to PNG and saved additionally as
    '*.gif.png'. Since GIF files aren't garanteed to work with Latex
    the PNG are being used.

    Add ChangeLog.txt for ./T3PythonDocBuilder.
    Introduce constants.py to keep common constants.
    Bump version number of ooxhtml2rst.py to __version__ = '1.2.0'.
    Refer to "docs.typo3.org" instead of "preview.docs.typo3.org"
    in the template.
    Do not write "DEFINE SOME TEXTROLES" any more in each ReST-file.
    Add ".. include:: [../]Includes.txt in each ReST-file.
    Do not create ReST version of type "flt" with directive
    "..†field-list-table::" anymore (but still ".. t3-field-list-table::").

    Prepend all sections with a label. Only sections made up by just
    underlining are covered.

    Add the Includes.txt file.
    Add the Targets.rst file.

    Tweak the "dllisttables(.py)". These are the "definition list
    structures" that are produced from the original "property tables" of
    the OpenOffice documents. Tweaking means: drop the first table row
    it is meaningless. Add a headline and label for each row.


2013-05-24 wishlist:

    go through the file structure (starting at Documentation)
    record the depth level
    in each file:
     remove the text role header
     add the include directive (with respect to depth)
     for each section heading
      add a label before it. Base the label on the section heading text.
     read t3-field-list-table structures
     for each such structure
      remove the first row
      for each other row
       repeat the t3-field-list-table declaration
       add a section heading before it (with a label) based on the property's (first field) name
